# Augmented TCF
Augmented TCF is an add-on/extension written by [Everest][everest_profile]. The goal of ATCF is to improve the quality
of and each user's experince using the [official Terraria Community Forums][tcf].

This project is currently under ðŸš§ **heavy** construction ðŸš§; as such, it's in a *very* unfinished state. Feel free to
look around, but expect everything to possibly undergo large changes.

If you want to know more about how to develop ATCF, see the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file. While you likely
shouldn't try to start working on features while the project is so early in development (ðŸ’• for the consideration),
feel more than welcome to suggest features and talk about the project.
